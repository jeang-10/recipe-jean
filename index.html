             <P>One-pot meals are such a lifesaver in my house, and this Haitian spaghetti recipe is no exception. Who doesn’t love whipping up a balanced meal of pasta, meat, and veggies – and then only having to wash one dish? I’m all about easy cleanup.</p>
               <p> And kids really love this dish, too, especially when I make it with hot dogs instead of pork sausage. Hot dogs and spaghetti? What kid wouldn’t like that? And if your kids don’t like spicy food, you can just leave out the scotch bonnet for a perfectly mild meal.</p>

             <h2 id="spaghetti">What Is Haitian Spaghetti?</h2>
               <p>Haitian spaghetti hails from Haiti, as you may have guessed. Ingredients commonly used in Haitian kitchens are red and green bell peppers, green onion, and scotch bonnet peppers. Basically, it’s spaghetti with tomato sauce, cut-up sausage, and plenty of veggies</p>.
               <p>Sometimes, Haitians enjoy this dish for breakfast! It certainly keeps you full and gives you plenty of energy for the day. However, I usually enjoy it for lunch or dinner.</p>

                   <h3>Prep the Ingredients</h3>
                 <ul>
                 <li>Cook Spaghetti – Heat a large pot of salted water to boil over medium heat. Add the pasta and cook as the package instructions indicate to al dente. (The time will depend on your choice of pasta.) (Photo 1)</li>
                   <li>Drain – When the pasta is ready, strain it in a sieve, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta water.</li> 
                    <li>Cook Sausage – Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add olive oil. Sauté the pork sausage until brown on both sides, about 2 minutes on each side. Set the sausage aside on a plate.  (Photo 2)</li>
                     <li>The Sauce – In the same skillet, sauté the white onions, garlic, thyme, and bell peppers for 2-3 minutes until softened. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, stir well, and cook for 2 more minutes.  (Photos 3-6)</li>
                     <li>Season – Next, add the scotch bonnet pepper and bouillon powder and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h3>Assemble</h3>
                 <ul>
                      <li>Simmer – Add ½ cup of reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce. Let the mixture simmer for 8-10 minutes.</li>
                      <li>Assemble – Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce and stir well to coat it with the sauce. Finally, add the pork sausage to the pasta and stir to combine.  (Photos 7-8)</li>
                       <li>Serve – Garnish with sliced green onions over the top, serve, and enjoy!</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2>Recipe Variations</h2>

                 <ul>
                     <li> Swap out the pasta. You can use any variety of pasta for this recipe, from penne to linguine.</li>
                     <li> Use a different meat. You can trade the sausage out with ground beef, turkey, lamb, hot dogs, or any other meat to this dish.</li>
                     <li> Skip the scotch bonnet. If you don’t do spicy foods, just leave out the scotch bonnet. This dish will still taste amazing sans hot peppers.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2 class="TAT"> Tips and Tricks</h2>
                 <ol">
                   <li>If the sauce seems a little too thick, add a few tablespoons of water left over from the spaghetti.</li>
                   <li>Please don’t overcook the pasta. Drain it as soon as it is al dente since you’ll be heating it back up in the sauce later. No one likes mushy pasta.</li> 🙅🏿‍♀️
                   <li>Add some extra garnishes if you please. Sliced avocado or boiled egg are typical garnishes that look pretty and add a lot of flavor to the dish. Fresh chopped parsley also looks and tastes great.</li>
                 </ol>

                 <h2 class="MAI">Make-Ahead Instructions</h2>

                   <p>Feel free to make this a day or two in advance because it tastes even better the next day. Store it in an airtight container in the fridge until you are ready to reheat it. You can also freeze it for up to three months.</p>
